Overview
  (text) indicates a option for a command or additional information
  [text] indicates required information to use the function\
  " " indicates a CLI input on a Cisco router

Unit 1
  Lab 1 - Used cmd commands to find informaiton on local and remote servers
    ipconfig (/all) - displays local IP information (/all displays additional information)
    ping [IP address] - sends 4 packets to target IP to test connectivity
    tracert [IP address] - displays what IP the packets go through on their way to target destination
    nslookup [DNS address] - displays DNS and IP information of a website address
    
    To open Command Prompt, hit the windows key/search bar and enter cmd

Unit 2
  Lab 1 - Using packet tracer
    Deploy hardware by selecting and dragging it from the bottom menu
    Connect cables by slecting them from the cables submenu, and clicking what you want to connect [computer port and connection port]
    To acess terminal, click the PC, Desktop, Terminal
  Lab 2 - Using WireShark
    Use the start/stop buttons to capture packets
    Sort through packets by clicking the column labels or using the search bar at the top
    arp (-a) - modifies internet address table
    
Unit 3
  Lab 1 - ARP requests
    View arp table with arp -a and delete it with arp -d on Windows (arp -n on Linux)
    arp sends out a MAC address request based on IP for the LAN, and then waits for a response from a computer with that IP
  Lab 2 - Exploring broadcasting domain
    Captured ICMP packets from Google and identified MAC addresses
    
Unit 4
  Lab 1 - Cisco packet routing
    Set the gateway on a computer by going to config, settings
    Set IP/subnet mask on a switch by going to config, [wire selection]
    Enter simulation mode by clicking the labled button on the right
    Use the edit filters button above simulation mode to filter the types of packets
  Lab 2 - ARP in Packet Tracer
    TURN ON PORT INTERFACES WHEN CONFIGURING ROUTER CABLES
    Hold the mouse over a device to view information
    show mac-address-table - shows the MAC address table in a router
    If router terminal looks like 'Switch>', enter 'enable' to enter admin mode
    If router terminal looks like 'Swtich (config)#', enter 'exit' to return to admin mode
  Lab 3 - Simple network packet tracing
    Use simulation mode to simulate packets being sent from devices
    Save router config by enabling Router - Config - Save NVRAM
  
Unit 5
  Lab 1 - Simple routing
    Packet tracer has a filter menu for packet types in the right hand corner of simulation
    
Unit 6
  Lab 2 - Subnetting
    Subnets work by reserving a range of IP addresses for a subnetwork by splicing the host address into two parts
      The subnet mask identifes which part is the network addr, and which is the host addr
    This field can be configured under the IP address field for end devices (dotted decimal format)
    As for all networks, first IP addr in a range is default gateway, last is boradcast addr

Unit 7
  Lab 2 - Subnetting in Packet Tracer
    There is a option in Packet Tracer to show what port a cable is connected to
 
Unit 8
  Lab 1 - Tracing routes
    tracert [IP or DNS addr] cmd command tracks the path a packet takes to a target desintation (traceroute in Linux)
    
Unit 9
  Lab 1 - Static Routing
    To create static routing paths, enter the CLI and enter config mode
    If not in config mode, enter "enable" and "config terminal"
    To create a route, type "ip route [network addr] [subnet mask] [serial connection on router]"
      Note that this has to be done individlaully on each router
    To test routes, leave config mode ("exit") and type "show ip route"
  Lab 2 - Static routing
    See above for how to create static paths
    Remember to test routes with "show ip route"
    
Unit 10
  Lab 1 - Understanding RIP
    To enable RIP, enter config mode on the CLI
    Type "router rip" then "version 2", then specify the directcly connected networks "network [ip addr]"
      This must be manually done for all routers
      
Unit 11
  Lab 1 - VLANs
    To set up a switch VLAN on Packet Tracer, go to Config: VLAN database and create a VLAN number and name
      VLAN creations will need to be done across all switches to properly connect VLANs together
    To create a Access port, select the connection port on the switch and change the VLAN number to the desired one
    To create a Trunk port, select the connection port on the switch and change the Access field to Trunk (all VLAN fields can be left enabled)
  Lab 2 -

Overview
  (text) indicates a option for a command
  [text] indicates required information to use the function

Unit 1
  Lab 1 - Used cmd commands to find informaiton on local and remote servers
    ipconfig (/all) - displays local IP information (/all displays additional information)
    ping [IP address] - sends 4 packets to target IP to test connectivity
    tracert [IP address] - displays what IP the packets go through on their way to target destination
    nslookup [DNS address] - displays DNS and IP information of a website address
    
    To open Command Prompt, hit the windows key/search bar and enter cmd

Unit 2
  Lab 1 - Using packet tracer
    Deploy hardware by selecting and dragging it from the bottom menu
    Connect cables by slecting them from the cables submenu, and clicking what you want to connect [computer port and connection port]
    To acess terminal, click the PC, Desktop, Terminal
  Lab 2 - Using WireShark
    Use the start/stop buttons to capture packets
    Sort through packets by clicking the column labels or using the search bar at the top
    arp (-a) - modifies internet address table
    
Unit 3
  Lab 1 - ARP requests
    View arp table with arp -a and delete it with arp -d on Windows (arp -n on Linux)
    arp sends out a MAC address request based on IP for the LAN, and then waits for a response from a computer with that IP
  Lab 2 - Exploring broadcasting domain
    Captured ICMP packets from Google and identified MAC addresses
    
Unit 4
  Lab 1 - Cisco packet routing
    Set the gateway on a computer by going to config, settings
    Set IP/subnet mask on a switch by going to config, [wire selection]
    Enter simulation mode by clicking the labled button on the right
    Use the edit filters button above simulation mode to filter the types of packets
  Lab 2 - ARP in Packet Tracer
    TURN ON PORT INTERFACES WHEN CONFIGURING ROUTER CABLES
    Hold the mouse over a device to view information
    show mac-address-table - shows the MAC address table in a router
    If router terminal looks like 'Switch>', enter 'enable' to enter admin mode
    If router terminal looks like 'Swtich (config)#', enter 'exit' to return to admin mode
  Lab 3 - Simple network packet tracing
    Use simulation mode to simulate packets being sent from devices
    Save router config by enabling Router - Config - Save NVRAM
  
Unit 5
  Lab 1 - Simple routing

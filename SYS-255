Week 1
  Machine Setup - Firewall
    Cable wires in VMware, WAN then LAN
    Assign interfaces (labled Reassign Interfaces, 1), check MAC address on NIC and VMware to check for errors
      To assign interfaces, ignore VLANs, WAN should be em0, LAN should be em1, skip other options
    Set IP Interfaces (2)
      Select the WAN, do not use DHCP, /24 subnet, gateway is 10.0.17.103, use gateway as name server, no IPv6, no HTTP for GUI
      Select the LAN, do not use DHCP, /24 subnet, IP is 10.0.5.2, no upstream gateway (hit enter), no DHCP, bypass IPv6, no LAN DHCP server, no revert to HTTP
  Machine Setup - Windows 10
    Name computer, file explorer - this PC - properties - change settings - rename PC
    Add Admin account, lusrmgr.msc
      name first.last-loc
      Add account to admin group (Administrators)
    Navigate to Firewall using Google
      Set IP/DNS address (set DNS to gateway if not setup)
      Leave DNS server override on PPP/WAN
      RFC1918 Networks: uncheck "block private networks from entering WAN"
      Set root password
   Testing - Pinging LAN and WAN from Firewall and Windows 10, all successful
  Lab 1 - System setup (Windows Server 2016, DHCP on CentOS, Firewall on FreeBSD, Windows 10)
    Named and configured firewall networks (options 1 and 2 of main menu, FreeBSD)
    Creating a new administrative user, using lursmgr.msc then creating a new user and assigning them to the admin group
    Configuring the IPv4 address, by Network Center – Status – Properties – IPv4 Protocol
    Changing the computer name, by going to File Explorer – This PC – Properties – Change Settings

Week 2
  Machine Setup - Windows Server
    Set Network Adapter to LAN, set password
      Allow PC to be discovered by other PCs on network
      Set IP, DNS (10.0.5.2, only pre-promotion), and hostname
    Installing ADDS
      Server Manager - Manage - Add Roles and Features, check Active Directory Domain Services
      Choose the Restart Destination Server, check Include Management Tools if possible
    Promote server to Domain Controller
      Create new forest, jonathan.local
      Add DSRM password
    DNS records
      Open DNS Manager - Foward Lookup Zone - jonathan.local, new host (A or AAAA), wks01-jonathan, 10.0.5.2, check update PTR record
      Reverse Lookup Zone, new zone for 10.0.5
      Create a new PTR record from the A record of fw01-yourname and ad01-yourname by unchecking, applying checking the update PTR record check box, and re-applying fw01's properties(c/p from lab, ignore if there's already PTR records in reverse lookup)?
    Domain Users
      AD DS, Active Directory Users and Computers, add a new user, jonathan.local-adm, uncheck change password, add to domain admin group
      Add new user jonathan.local as standard account
    Windows 10 config
      Set DNS to 10.0.5.5
      Add PC to domain, same location as change PC name, domain jonathan, enter Domain Admin credentials
    Testing
      Check Active Directory Users and Computers to verify Windows 10 is there
      Use nslookup on all devices to verify accurate DNS records (IP and hostname)
  Lab 1 - Windows Server, ADDS, DNS
    Used Server Manager - Local Server Manager to setup network configuration
    Installed ADDS via Server Manger - Manage - Add Roles and Features
    Promoted the server to a domain controller
    Adjust DNS settings via Server Menu - DNS Manager, then add the related DNS record
    "A" records foward website names, "PTR" records foward IP names, "CNAME" records link seperate website names
    Created new users and assigned them to groups
    To lookup domains and use recursive searching in nslookup, type "set type=ns" after entering nslookup in cmd
    
Week 3
  Machine Setup - CentOS7 - DHCP
    Configure networking using nmtui
      Configure cabling with LAN, WAN
      Add local admin account
      Add DNS records for the DHCP machine on Windows Server
      Test ping to google.com (from CentOS) and dhcp01-jonathan (from Windows Server)
  Lab 1 - Setting up CentOS7
    Fixed a highly problematic network error by swapping the network adapters on vSphere
      Always make sure default network is on the primary adapter, do not leave it on adapter 2+
    Networking setup - “nmtui” into the terminal
      Use that application to select the primary network card
      Open (show) ipv4 and input the address (include subnet), gateway, DNS, and domain
      If needed, configure the hostname from the main menu
      
Week 4
  Lab 1 - Configuring DHCP on CentOS7
    Configure DHCP on sudo [text editor] /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
    When downloading PuTTY, disable Enhanced Security Configuration
    To start DHCP, "systemctl start DHCP", and swap "start" for "status" to check for errors
    When setting up the firewall, use "--permanent" when applying permanent changes
    DHCP related packets, source - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/troubleshoot/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-basics
      DCHPOFFER - UDP packet that offers a IP address
      DHCPREQUEST - UDP packet that responds to a DHCP offer, confirming that the computer wants a IP address
      DHCPACK - UDP packet that gives out a IP address in response to a DHCP request
     To enable/disable remote ssh root, access /etc/ssh/ssh_config and set PermitRootLogin to yes/no (remember to restart ssh)

    Downloaded File Server Management Tools (RSAT) to the Active Directory Server
    Added File Server to known servers on Active Directory (right click All Servers in AD)
    Added Security Group under folder, along with related users in Group Policy
    Used command "netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=”Remote File Server Resource Manager Management” new enable=yes" to open File Server for managing
    Stated a File Share on the File Server, added Security Group to Full Control Permissions

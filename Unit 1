Unit 2, Number Systems, converting Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal
  Lab #2a: Converted IPv4, IPv6, Binary, and Hexadecimal numbers respectively
    Decimal to Binary: Subtract the largest number possible each time using binary until nothing remains while creating the binary "1s" in their repective places
    Hexadecimal to Binary: Seperate each hexadecimal number, and convert it into a 4 bit binary string, then recombine the strings to get the number
    Binary to Decimal/Hexadecimal: If Decimal, add the number to the decimal string until the final number is given, and if Hexadecimal, break the Binary string into sets of 4, change them into a hexadecimal number, then combine them
  Lab #2b: Used a virtual machine through a existing file
    Downloaded a VM file, opened it using VMware, then powered on and used it
  Lab #3a: Used cmd commands to modify a .bat file, adding tree and systeminfo functionality
    Tree: lists subdirectiories from the current place
    systeminfo: outputs system information, such as CPU and NIC
    Write out commands, then use ">" and a filename.txt to output results
    Use "set" commands to create variables, as well as set values with %examplevalue%
   Lab #4: Used cmd on a virtual machine to analyze CPU statistics
    Launch Task Manager from Ctrl-Alt-Del or Ctrl-Shift-Esc
    Use wmic to analyze information on a process (ex. use "wmic cpu get _____"), such as cores and L2 space

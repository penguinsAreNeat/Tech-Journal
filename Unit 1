Unit 2, Number Systems, converting Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal
  Lab #2a: Converted IPv4, IPv6, Binary, and Hexadecimal numbers respectively
    Decimal to Binary: Subtract the largest number possible each time using binary until nothing remains while creating the binary "1s" in their repective places
    Hexadecimal to Binary: Seperate each hexadecimal number, and convert it into a 4 bit binary string, then recombine the strings to get the number
    Binary to Decimal/Hexadecimal: If Decimal, add the number to the decimal string until the final number is given, and if Hexadecimal, break the Binary string into sets of 4, change them into a hexadecimal number, then combine them
  Lab #2b: Used a virtual machine through a existing file
    Downloaded a VM file, opened it using VMware, then powered on and used it
  Lab #3a: Used cmd commands to modify a .bat file, adding tree and systeminfo functionality
    Tree: lists subdirectiories from the current place
    systeminfo: outputs system information, such as CPU and NIC
    Write out commands, then use ">" and a filename.txt to output results
    Use "set" commands to create variables, as well as set values with %examplevalue%
   Lab #4: Used cmd on a virtual machine to analyze CPU statistics
    Launch Task Manager from Ctrl-Alt-Del or Ctrl-Shift-Esc
    Use wmic to analyze information on a process (ex. use "wmic cpu get _____"), such as cores and L2 space
   Lab #5: Used cmd to dump files in RAM memory from a VM, including the password hashes of users\
    Use Volaility with "vol.exe"
      plist shows running programs, cmdline shows file path to process, hashdump prints the password hashes to screen
      procdump exports data on a process to a set folder in .txt format
   Lab #6: Used wmic on C: drive to find disk informaiton
     Disk space can be viewed through properties
     Use "wmic (diskdrive/logicaldrive) get ________" for drive information (logicaldrive is the disk formatted by the OS, and doesn't use all disk space)

     For me, the three most important componets are the CPU, RAM, and the motherboard. For my family memeberss, I would prioritize the case, CPU, and graphics card
     When my monitor failed to turn on, I ended up trying random things to see if the computer was on, and verified that the monitor weas recieving power. Through trial and error I eventually figured out that there were no batteries in the remote (the monitor was a repurposed TV), which although was not what the book recommended, I don't think I would follow it due to me being a bit lazy

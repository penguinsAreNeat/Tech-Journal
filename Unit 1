Unit 2, Number Systems, converting Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal
  Lab #2a: Converted IPv4, IPv6, Binary, and Hexadecimal numbers respectively
    Decimal to Binary: Subtract the largest number possible each time using binary until nothing remains while creating the binary "1s" in their repective places
    Hexadecimal to Binary: Seperate each hexadecimal number, and convert it into a 4 bit binary string, then recombine the strings to get the number
    Binary to Decimal/Hexadecimal: If Decimal, add the number to the decimal string until the final number is given, and if Hexadecimal, break the Binary string into sets of 4, change them into a hexadecimal number, then combine them
  Lab #2b: Used a virtual machine through a existing file
    Downloaded a VM file, opened it using VMware, then powered on and used it
  Lab #3a: Used cmd commands to modify a .bat file, adding tree and systeminfo functionality
    Tree: lists subdirectiories from the current place
    systeminfo: outputs system information, such as CPU and NIC
    Write out commands, then use ">" and a filename.txt to output results
    Use "set" commands to create variables, as well as set values with %examplevalue%
   Lab #4: Used cmd on a virtual machine to analyze CPU statistics
    Launch Task Manager from Ctrl-Alt-Del or Ctrl-Shift-Esc
    Use wmic to analyze information on a process (ex. use "wmic cpu get _____"), such as cores and L2 space
   Lab #5: Used cmd to dump files in RAM memory from a VM, including the password hashes of users\
    Use Volaility with "vol.exe"
      plist shows running programs, cmdline shows file path to process, hashdump prints the password hashes to screen
      procdump exports data on a process to a set folder in .txt format
   Lab #6: Used wmic on C: drive to find disk informaiton
     Disk space can be viewed through properties
     Use "wmic (diskdrive/logicaldrive) get ________" for drive information (logicaldrive is the disk formatted by the OS, and doesn't use all disk space) such as tracks, cylinders, sectors, and total disk size
   Chapter 6 readings:
     For me, the three most important componets are the CPU, RAM, and the motherboard. For my family memeberss, I would prioritize the case, CPU, and graphics card
     When my monitor failed to turn on, I ended up trying random things to see if the computer was on, and verified that the monitor weas recieving power. Through trial and error I eventually figured out that there were no batteries in the remote (the monitor was a repurposed TV), which although was not what the book recommended, I don't think I would follow it due to me being a bit lazy
  Lab #8: Used Microsoft SysInternals to view Startup, Autorun, and Disk Usage on a Windows VM
     Working Set: Amount of recently used data (RAM) by a process
     Private Bytes: Data that has been allocated to a process and cannot be shared
     Use "autorunsc.exe" to run Autoruns via command line, and -c to export a copy of the data (include ">" and file name to .csv)
     Use "du –c “c:\Program Files\*”" to run Disk Utility, and -C to list output as .csv or -l to list commands
  Lab #9: Used Windows Ease of Access options to experiment with display settings
     Text size can be adjusted in display settings
     Color filter/high contrast can be found under the Ease of Acess menu in Settings
     Stickey keys can be toggled under the Ease of Access menu found in Ctrl-Alt-Del
     Keyboard layout can be changed through the Change Input Methods, in Clock, Language and Region under Control Panel
  Lab #10a: Used ping, nslookup, and tracert to find Champlain's webserver
     "ping" sends 4 packets to a target IP
     "nslookup" find the name of a server with it's IP address
     "tracert" pings a IP address, then sends information on each server/relay it goes through back to the computer
  Lab #10b: Downloaded sysinternal programs to research public information via cmd
    TCPView provides data like a advanced task manager moniter
    whois (used in cmd) provides some information when given a DNS server

    Hexadecimal to Binary: Seperate each hexadecimal number, and convert it into a 4 bit binary string, then recombine the strings to get the number
    Binary to Decimal/Hexadecimal: If Decimal, add the number to the decimal string until the final number is given, and if Hexadecimal, break the Binary string into sets of 4, change them into a hexadecimal number, then combine them

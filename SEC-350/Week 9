  Remember to add the relevant authorized users in the select users menu

RDP through SSH jump box:
  Configure Putty to go to the jump computer
  In the Connections - SSH - Tunnels tab, fill out the source port field (any unused port) and the [target IP]:3389 in the destination field, then click add
  Open the Putty connection and log in to the jump box
  Then open a RDP session to [loopback IPv4]:[source port], with source port being what you entered into the Putty field; 127.0.0.1 will work fine for the loopback address
  Assuming RDP privleges have been correctly configured for your user, that should work

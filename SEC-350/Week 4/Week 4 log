Active networks:
  WAN
  DMZ
  LAN
    MGMT

Active machines:
  rw01 (WAN) - Ubuntu, exterior computer
  fw01 (WAN/LAN/DMZ) - VyOS firewall, handles routing
  web01 (DMZ) - CentOS7, hosts company website
  wks01 (LAN) - Windows 10
  fw-mgmt (LAN/MGMT) - VyOS firewall between LAN and MGMT
  mgmt01 (LAN) - Ubuntu
  mgmt02 (MGMT) - Windows Server 2016
  wazuh (MGMT) - Ubuntu

Task:
  Create firewalls between the DMZ, WAN, and LAN
  Allow inbound HTTP traffic to web01
  Allow established connections on firewalls
  Allow SSH connections from mgmt01 to DMZ
  Create a firewall between LAN and MGMT

Firewall config:
  Replace set with delete to delete a config

  set zone-policy zone [name] interface [interface] - Creates the zone used to identify networks
  set firewall name [name] default-action drop - Creates firewall, drops all by default
  set firewall name [name] enable-default-log - Enables logging
  set zone-policy zone [zone1] from [zone2] firewall name [name] - Assigns a firewall for zone2 from zone1, remember to do a vise-versa firewall

  set firewall name [name] rule [int] action [drop, accept] - Creates a new firewall rule numbered [int], with a default action
  set firewall name [name] rule [int] description "[text]" - Adds description
  set firewall name [name] rule [int] [disable, enable] - Enable or disable rule

  set firewall name [name] rule [int] [source, destination] address [IPv4, IPv4/s]
  set firewall name [name] rule [int] [source, destination] port [port ID, name, int range]
    Note - Lists can be used in the IPv4/port ID fields, such as '5, 23-46'
    Note - adding a '!' to the IPv4/port ID field will allow everything but that entry
  set firewall name [name] rule [int] protocol [tcp, udp, tcp_udp, int 0-255]

A issue with the RIP LAN subnet (172.16.50.0) being assinged to the incorrect interface caused some issues
Issues with VyOS source IP addresses meant that in some cases only the destination IP firewall filter was applied

Rsyslog host setup - desinged for CentOS7, see Other for different operating system  
  Install with yum install rsyslog
  Restart program after making changes (systemctl enable, restart)
  Allow traffic from TCP/UDP 514 in firewall

  To recieve rsyslog messages uncomment the lines in the Modules section labled "Provides (UDP/TCP, for both of these) syslog reception" in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and create a custom drop-in file (see Drop-In at the bottom for details)
    Messages will be sent to /var/log/syslog by default
    To enable high-precision timestamps, uncomment the "Action File Default Template" in the Global Directives section
    Test - netstat -tupan | grep 514, should show Listen labels on port 514

Target computer
  Create [name].conf file in /etc/rsyslog.d/

  Config file
    user.notice @[host IPv4] - basic information
  Test - tail -f /var/log/messages on host

Other operating system notes
  Ubuntu - install with apt-get (apt-get install rsyslog)
  Rocky Linux - install with dnf (dnf install rsyslog)
  VyOS - Installed by default
    set system syslog host [host IPv4] facility authpriv level info - sends logon and failed logon info to server as well as less useful authenitcation messages
    delete system syslog host [IPv4] - deletes configuration


Drop-on log configuration file (in /etc/rsyslog.d):
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514" ruleset="RemoteDevice")
template(name="DynFile" type="string"
	string="/var/log/remote-syslog/%HOSTNAME%/%$YEAR%.%$MONTH%.%$DAY%.%PROGRAMNAME%.log"
)
ruleset(name="RemoteDevice"){

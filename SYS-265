Lab 00 - Enviorment Setup
  Fun fact! It is possible to join a domain while specifiying a local Admin account, but it will not authenticate with Kerberos 
    That is 2 hours of my life I will never get back
  Configured fw01 network, gateway, then finished using pfsense config
  Set computer networks to use LAN instead of default WAN
  Set up Domain on ad01
    Joined mgmt01, wks01 to Domain
  Added admin user to Windows Domain, CentOS computers
  
  Confusing terms:
    Get-DnsServerResourceRecord - could not get command to display PTR records
    Enumerate, in DNS context
    RFC1918 Private Networks - found in pfsense config, not sure what this does
    
Assignment 02-1 - DHCP Installation on Active Directory
  Installed via server manager
  Changed Domain Administrator account to be a part of the Domain Admin group, not just local Admin
    Server requried a restart for account change to take effect, created authorization problem when trying to connect DHCP server to AD server (they were still both on the same machine)
  For wks01:
    Deleted existing DNS records
    Removed the static IP addrress

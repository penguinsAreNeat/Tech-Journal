Lab Enviorment: vSphere vms
  ad01 - Active Directory on Windows Server Core
  fw01 - Firewall/gateway running on FreeBSD, coifigured with pfsense
  mgmt01 - Server Manager 2019, also running DNS server
  nmon01 - CentOS7
  web01 - CentOS7
  wks01 - Windows 10

Lab 00 - Enviorment Setup
  Fun fact! It is possible to join a domain while specifiying a local Admin account, but it will not authenticate with Kerberos 
    That is 2 hours of my life I will never get back
  Configured fw01 network, gateway, then finished using pfsense config
  Set computer networks to use LAN instead of default WAN
  Set up Domain on ad01
    Joined mgmt01, wks01 to Domain
  Added admin user to Windows Domain, CentOS computers
  
  Confusing terms:
    Get-DnsServerResourceRecord - could not get command to display PTR records
    Enumerate, in DNS context
    RFC1918 Private Networks - found in pfsense config, not sure what this does
    
Assignment 02-1 - DHCP Installation on Active Directory
  Installed via server manager
  Changed Domain Administrator account to be a part of the Domain Admin group, not just local Admin
    Server requried a restart for account change to take effect, created authorization problem when trying to connect DHCP server to AD server (they were still both on the same machine)
  For wks01:
    Deleted existing DNS records
    Removed the static IP addrress

 Lab 02 - Network Management, SNMP
  Enabled SNMP services on pfsense (pfsense webpage, services, SNMP (restart after config)) 
  Installed "snmp-network-utils" and "net-snmp" to install a snmp server on web01, replaced config file with custom config file
    Remeber to restart service and allow snmp port 161 through firewall (and --permanet tag!)
  Installed snmp service on ad01, snmp remote admin tools on mgmt01 with Server Manager
  Set ad01 to allow remote powershell sessions and remote computer managment (the latter needs the "Remote Event Log Managment" firewall rule group enabled)
    Guide link for powershell sessions: https://www.howtogeek.com/117192/how-to-run-powershell-commands-on-remote-computers/
  Sample snmp query line: snmpwalk -Os -c [Read Community String] -v2c [targer computer]
    [RCS] is the RCS value entered into pfsense
    
  Reflection:
    DNS problems requried that the domain name be specified as well as the computer name in cmd, unsure why
    tcpdump - is this a built in packet capture function?
    snmp command format - what does -v2c mean?
    
 Lab 04 - Docker
  Set up a new VM using Ubuntu cloud server
    Configured IP by using "ifconfig [interface name] [ip address] netmask [subnet mask]
    Configured hostname wth "hostnamectl set-hostname [name]"
    Added named sudo user (not wheel like in CentOS), disabled root ssh
  Installed Docker using the following instructions: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04
  Installed Wordpress container with the following guide: https://upcloud.com/resources/tutorials/wordpress-with-docker
  
  Docker commands:
    version: prints installed version
    run: creates a named container and runs it; is capeable of pulling resources from the web
    images: shows the installed images 
    ps: shows Docker containers
